----------------------------------------------------
    Quickstart:
----------------------------------------------------

1.  Download Twitter Bootstrap (branch 2.x) in /sites/all/libraries/bootstrap/
    The only folders required are :
    /sites/all/libraries/bootstrap/js
    /sites/all/libraries/bootstrap/less

2.  Install bootship in one of the usual places for the themes:
    /sites/all/themes
    /sites/default/themes
    /sites/[SITENAME]/themes

3.  Copy the "NEWTHEME" folder inside the usual places for themes:
    /sites/all/themes/NEWTHEME
    /sites/[SITENAME]/themes/NEWTHEME
    Rename the NEWTHEME folder & NEWTHEME.info

4.  Download FontAwesome fonts inside the "font" folder of your new theme
    For example, if you used /sites/all/themes/NEWTHEME, the only required files are :
    /sites/all/themes/NEWTHEME/font/fontawesome-webfont.ttf
    /sites/all/themes/NEWTHEME/font/fontawesome-webfont.woff
    /sites/all/themes/NEWTHEME/font/fontawesome-webfont.eot

5.  Adapt the theme settings to your liking : admin/appearance/settings/NEWTHEME
    Look in mothership/documentation for documentation of all the settings.
